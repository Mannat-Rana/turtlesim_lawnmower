## About
The goal of this application is to develop a lawnmower pattern with the Turtlesim Simulator that takes a starting (x, y) coordinate, a height, and a width for the pattern. This application is developed as part of the first homework assignment in the course SES 598: Autonomous Exploration Systems at Arizona State University.
